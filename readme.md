### Data Augmentation for Image Classification Tasks

#### Mini Project for COMP7250 Machine Learning

Author: ZHU Qinghui

Institution: Hong Kong Baptist University



The project is constructed based on Jupyter Notebook, concentrating on how image data augmentation will influence the training process and result of a CNN. Image dataset using Cifar-10 <[CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets (toronto.edu)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)>, deep learning framework using Keras. The outline has been well constructed, feel free to use it for skipping.



Run through main.ipynb to regenerate the results. 

The results involve training process (training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, validation accuracy), loss-epoch plot and accuracy-epoch plot, prediction reports, confusion matrices and prediction visualizations.
